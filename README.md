# CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python

## Welcome

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. 

### What You'll Learn

- **Functions, arguments, and return values** (oh my!)
- **Variables and types**
- **Conditionals and Boolean expressions**
- **Loops**
- **Exception handling** - find and fix bugs, write unit tests
- **Third-party libraries**
- **Regular expressions** - validate and extract data
- **Object-oriented programming** - model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties
- **File I/O** - read and write files

### Course Features

- **Hands-on opportunities** for lots of practice
- **Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems**
- **No software required** except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac

### Relationship to CS50x

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

## How to Take this Course

Even if you are not a student at Harvard, you are welcome to "take" this course for free via this OpenCourseWare by working your way through the course's ten weeks of material. 

### Weekly Workflow (Recommended)

For each week, follow this workflow:

1. **Watch Lecture**
2. **Watch Shorts**
3. **Submit Problem Set**

And then submit the course's **final project**.

### Getting Started

To submit the course's problem sets and final project for feedback, be sure to create an **edX account**, if you haven't already. Ask questions along the way via any of the course's communities!

### Certificate Options

- **Verified certificate from edX**: Enroll at [cs50.edx.org/python](https://cs50.edx.org/python)
- **Professional certificate from edX**: 
  - Python track: [cs50.edx.org/programs/python](https://cs50.edx.org/programs/python)
  - Data Science track: [cs50.edx.org/programs/data](https://cs50.edx.org/programs/data)

## How to Teach this Course

If you are a teacher, you are welcome to adopt or adapt these materials for your own course, per the license. Additionally, we encourage teachers to participate in the **CS50 Educator Workshop** to learn more about CS50's curriculum, technology, and pedagogy.
